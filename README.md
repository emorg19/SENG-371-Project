### NextJS

NextJS is a React-based framework for building server-rendered applications. It provides a lot of out-of-the-box features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance. NextJS also has a lot of plugins and integrations with other libraries and frameworks that make it easy to extend and customize.

### React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to build reusable UI components that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces. React is known for its declarative syntax, which makes it easy to understand and reason about complex UIs.

### MySQL

MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system. It is used for storing and retrieving data in web applications. MySQL is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. It also has a large community of users and developers who contribute to its development and support.

### MUI

MUI (formerly Material-UI) is a React UI library that provides a set of reusable components that follow Google's Material Design guidelines. It makes it easy to build responsive, mobile-first UIs that look and feel great. MUI also provides theming capabilities that allow developers to customize the look and feel of their UIs.

### Docker

Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package their applications into containers that can be run on any platform. Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to run applications, making it easy to deploy and scale applications across different environments.

### docker-compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows developers to define their application's services, networks, and volumes in a single file, making it easy to deploy and manage complex applications.

### Makefile

Makefile is a build automation tool that allows developers to define tasks and dependencies in a simple text file. It is commonly used in Unix-based systems to automate repetitive tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, and deploying applications.

### Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter that automatically formats code to a consistent style. It helps developers to write code that is easy to read and maintain by enforcing a consistent coding style across the entire codebase.

### Jest

Jest is a testing framework for JavaScript applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for testing components, functions, and other parts of an application. Jest is known for its ease of use and fast execution speed.
